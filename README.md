## Overview

**Redirect Confirmer** is a simple and effective tool for validating redirects on your website. By appending the target link to the base URL, you can quickly and easily test and confirm the behavior of your site's redirects. This is especially useful for debugging and ensuring smooth user navigation.

### Key Features

- **Redirect Confirmation**: Add the desired path after the base URL to see how your redirects perform.
- **Custom 404 Page**: Utilizes a custom `404.html` page to make redirect testing pages functional and intuitive.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Built for efficiency and speed, hosted on Vercel for seamless performance.

## How It Works

1. Visit the website at [redirect-confirmer.vercel.app](https://redirect-confirmer.vercel.app/).
2. Append the intended redirect path to the URL (e.g., `https://redirect-confirmer.vercel.app/example-path`).
3. The website processes and confirms the redirect behavior based on the appended path.

## Usage Scenarios

- Debugging and testing URL redirects during website development.
- Verifying redirect rules and behavior after deploying updates.
- Ensuring user-friendly navigation across your web pages.

## Deployment Details

- Hosted on **Vercel** for high availability and performance.
- Leverages a custom `404.html` page to manage redirect validation.
